## Solution Overview

Connected Mobility Solution on AWS (CMS) provides a connected vehicle platform with various capabilities for automotive industry customers to leverage. With widespread electrification of vehicles across the automotive industry, battery health monitoring and alerting becomes increasingly crucial for automotive manufacturers, fleet managers and individual vehicle owners alike. With the increasing pace of development of novel battery technologies, developing new methods and standards for continuously monitoring the battery health is important. CMS EV Battery Health module provides battery health monitoring and alerting capability by means of configurable dashboards and alerts based on vehicle telemetry data.

## AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and
[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create
well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best
practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

## Instructions
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NVM
- NPM 8+
- Node 18+
- Pipenv

#### Optional but Helpful

- Pyenv

Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

#### MacOS Installation Instructions

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

Pipenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

NVM [Github Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

NPM/Node [Official Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git
cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws
cd templates/modules/cms_ev_battery_health_on_aws/
```

### Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization
passes the tests:

```bash
chmod +x deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
./deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
```

### Build

#### Build Using Script

The build script manages dependencies, builds required assets (e.g. packaged lambdas), and creates the
AWS Cloudformation templates.

```bash
./deployment/build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

Upload AWS Cloudformation templates

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name cfn-demo --template-body file://cfn-demo.yaml
```

#### Manually Build

Install development packages

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

Synthesize into Cloudformation

```bash
cdk synth
```

### Pre-deploy Instructions

Enable AWS IAM Identity Center in your account by following these [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-enable-identity-center.html)

### Deploy

```bash
cdk deploy
```

### Post-deploy Instructions

Once the solution is deployed, follow the steps detailed below to access the Grafana workspace which contains the EV battery health dashboard and alert rules.

#### AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO)

Follow the instructions for Step 1 and Step 2 in the AWS IAM Identity Center [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to create users.

#### Amazon Managed Grafana

1. Navigate to Amazon Managed Grafana from the AWS console
   ![Navigate to Amazon Managed Grafana Console](documentation/images/readme/amazon-managed-grafana-console.png)
2. Click on the newly created workspace named `ev-battery-health-grafana-workspace-<STAGE>`
3. In the authentication tab within the Grafana workspace console, click the `Assign new user or group` button under the `AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO)` section
   ![Amazon Identity Center Authentication](documentation/images/readme/grafana-iam-identity-center-authentication.png)
4. Assign the users created in `AWS IAM Identity Center` to the Grafana workspace
   ![Assign SSO Users to Grafana](documentation/images/readme/grafana-assign-users-to-workspace.png)
5. Set the appropriate role for the assigned user. Click the checkbox next to the user and on the top right corner click the `Actions` dropdown and choose the role to assign to the user
   ![Assign Grafana workspace role to user](documentation/images/readme/grafana-assign-user-role.png)
6. In the Grafana workspace page in the console, click on the workspace URL and sign in using the `AWS IAM Identity Center` credentials to access the Grafana workspace
   ![Grafana Workspace URL](documentation/images/readme/grafana-navigate-to-workspace.png)

#### Grafana workspace

1. To access the dashboard, navigate to `Home -> Dashboards -> General -> EV Battery Health Dashboard` in the Grafana workspace
2. To access the alert rules, navigate to `Home -> Alerting -> Alert rules` in the Grafana workspace

## Customizing the Solution

1. Customizing the dashboard: add/remove panels in the `create_ev_battery_health_dashboard` function [here](./source/handlers/custom_resource/lib/dashboards.py)
2. Customizing the alerts: add/remove alert rules in the `create_ev_battery_health_alert_rule_group` function [here](./source/handlers/custom_resource/lib/alerts.py)

## Securing the Solution

### Network Access Control
To configure network access control for the Grafana workspace, follow the documentation provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-configure-nac.html).

## Cost Scaling

Check out Amazon Managed Grafana pricing [here](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/pricing/).

## Collection of Operational Metrics

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the solution. For
more information, including how to disable this capability, please see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/cms-provisioningr/operational-metrics.html).
