## Solution Overview

## Architecture Diagram

## AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and
[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create
well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best
practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

## Customizing the Module

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NVM
- NPM 8+
- Node 18+
- Pipenv

#### Optional but Helpful

- Pyenv

Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

#### MacOS Installation Instructions

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

Pipenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

NVM [Github Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

NPM/Node [Official Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git
cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws
cd templates/modules/cms_alerts_on_aws/
```

### Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization
passes the tests:

```bash
chmod +x deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
./deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
```

### Build

#### Build Using Script

The build script manages dependencies, builds required assets (e.g. packaged lambdas), and creates the
AWS Cloudformation templates.

```bash
./deployment/build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

Upload AWS Cloudformation templates

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name cfn-demo --template-body file://cfn-demo.yaml
```

#### Manually Build

Install development packages

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

Synthesize into Cloudformation

```bash
cdk synth
```

### Deploy

```bash
cdk deploy
```

### Delete

```bash
cdk destroy
python ./deployment/clean_sns_topic.py
```

## Cost Scaling

Basic usage should stay within the free tier.

## Collection of Operational Metrics

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the solution. For
more information, including how to disable this capability, please see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/cms-provisioningr/operational-metrics.html).
