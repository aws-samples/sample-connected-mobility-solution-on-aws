## Solution Overview
CMS API on AWS is a deployable module within [Connected Mobility Solution on AWS](/README.md) (CMS)
that provides a centralized GraphQL API to serve telemetric data to authorized consumers using `AppSync`.

For more information and a detailed deployment guide, visit the
[Connected Mobility Solution on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/)
solution page.

## AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and
[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create
well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best
practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

## Customizing the Module

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NVM
- NPM 8+
- Node 18+
- Pipenv

#### Optional but Helpful

- Pyenv

Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

#### MacOS Installation Instructions

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

Pipenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

NVM [Github Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

NPM/Node [Official Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git
cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws
cd templates/modules/cms_api_on_aws/
```

### Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization
passes the tests:

```bash
chmod +x deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
./deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
```

### Build

#### Build Using Script

The build script manages dependencies, builds required assets (e.g. packaged lambdas), and creates the
AWS Cloudformation templates.

```bash
./deployment/build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

Upload AWS Cloudformation templates

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name cfn-demo --template-body file://cfn-demo.yaml
```

#### Manually Build

Install development packages

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

Synthesize into Cloudformation

```bash
cdk synth
```

### Deploy

```bash
cdk deploy
```

## Usage

### GraphQL
The CMS API module implements a GraphQL API for serving vehicle data. You can learn more about GraphQL and how to use it [here](https://graphql.org/learn/).

### Authorization
Users of the API will need to provide a valid bearer token in the Authorization header of each request. This should be an access token obtained from the token endpoint of the configured Identity Provider.

### Adding GraphQL Operations
The graphql file containing the available operations is located at `./source/infrastructure/assets/graphql/schemas/vss_operations.graphql`. At synthesis time this file and all others located in this directory are bundled into a single graphql schema file named `vss_schema.graphql`.

To add additional operations the `vss_operations.graphql` file should be updated with the new query or mutation type. Also, changes should be made to the Athena data source lambda to build and execute the correct Athena query for that operation.

### Generate GraphQL Schema
The data models used by CMS are generated by scripts offered by the [vss-tools](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools/blob/e95d3f24b0cb161873dd53b39fe8ecbecfe8706c/docs/VSS2GRAPHQL.md) repository. Assets for the default data models are already configured for the solution, however, a user may want to use a different version of the VSS specification or fork the repository and customize the specification to fit their needs. This can be done using the `generate_models.py` script provided:
```bash
python ./Connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/deployment/generate_models.py
```
After generating new models, the files must be moved to the appropriate location within the repository and replace the existing models. In CMS API `./source/infrastructure/assets/graphql/schemas/vss_types.graphql` must be updated with the newly generated file.

### Generate Postman Collection

After deploying the solution a Postman collection can be generated to test and interact with the API.

```bash
cd ./deployment/postman_collection
npm install
node index.js --stack-name <name-of-cloud-formation-stack> --region <region-of-cloud-formation-stack>
```

A file named `cms_graphql_api_postman_collection.json` will be generated that can be [imported into Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/).


## Cost Scaling

Cost will scale on the size of the data the Athena query scans and longer scan times incurring greater lambda costs. At rest, the API's cost should be minimal.

[AppSync Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/pricing/)


## Collection of Operational Metrics

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the solution. For
more information, including how to disable this capability, please see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/cms-provisioningr/operational-metrics.html).
