## Solution Overview

The CMS Backstage Module is an opinionated deployment of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/). Backstage provides a convenient
and functional interface to manage and deploy software. CMS modules are configured to be compatible with Backstage while enabling
deeper features into the Backstage design.

For more information and a detailed deployment guide, visit the
[CMS Backstage Module](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/cms-backstage/) solution page.

## AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and
[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create
well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best
practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

## Customizing the Module

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [NPM 8+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Node 18+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)

#### Optional but Helpful

- Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

#### MacOS Installation Instructions

Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.9
```

Pipenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

NVM [Github Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

NPM/Node [Official Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git
cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/source/backstage
```

### Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests:

```bash
chmod +x deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
./deployment/run-unit-tests.sh
```

### Build

#### Manually Build

Install development packages

```bash
yarn install
yarn build:all
```

Synthesize into Cloudformation

```bash
cd cdk
cdk synth
```

### Deploy

#### One-click deploy

- Get the link of the `cms-backstage-on-aws.template` uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
- Deploy the CMS Backstage Module solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using
  the S3 link of the `cms-backstage-on-aws.template`.

#### Deploy using script

```bash
./deployment/deploy-s3-dist.sh
```

#### Manually deploy

```bash
cd cdk
cdk deploy
```

## Cost Scaling

Basic usage should stay within the free tier.

## Collection of Operational Metrics

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the solution. For
more information, including how to disable this capability, please see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/cms-backstage/operational-metrics.html).
