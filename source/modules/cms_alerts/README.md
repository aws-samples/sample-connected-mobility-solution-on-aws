## Solution Overview

CMS Alerts is a deployable module within [Connected Mobility Solution on AWS](/README.md) (CMS)
that enables a notification mechanism for vehicles and modules to send alerts to user via email.
A User must subscribe to these notification via subscription management API provided in the module,
and modules can send the notification via publish API.

For more information and a detailed deployment guide, visit the
[CMS Alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/alerts-module.html)
Implementation Guide page.

## AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and
[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create
well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best
practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

## Customizing the Module

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [NPM 8+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Node 18+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)

### MacOS Installation Instructions

Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.12
```

Pipenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv sync --dev
```

NVM [Github Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

NPM/Node [Official Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git
cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/source/modules/cms_alerts/
```

### Install Required Dependencies

```bash
make install
```

### Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization
passes the tests:

```bash
make test
```

### Build the Module

The build script manages dependencies, builds required assets (e.g. packaged lambdas), and creates the
AWS Cloudformation templates.

```bash
make build
```

### Upload Assets to S3

```bash
make upload
```

### Deploy on AWS

```bash
make deploy
```

### Delete

```bash
make destroy
python ./deployment/script_clean_sns_topic.py
```

## Cost Scaling

Cost will scale depending on usage of the API, and number of subscriptions and notifications.

- [AWS AppSync Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/pricing/)
- [Amazon SQS Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing/)
- [AWS Lambda Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/)
- [Amazon DynamoDB Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)

For more details, see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/cost.html).

## Collection of Operational Metrics

This solution collects anonymized operational metrics to help AWS improve
the quality and features of the solution. For more information, including
how to disable this capability, please see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/anonymized-data-collection.html).
