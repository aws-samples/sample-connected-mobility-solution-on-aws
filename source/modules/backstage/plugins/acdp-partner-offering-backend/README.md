# acdp-partner-offering

Welcome to the acdp-partner-offering backend plugin!

This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/acdpPartnerOfferingPlugin/health](http://localhost:7007/api/acdpPartnerOfferingPlugin/health).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.
