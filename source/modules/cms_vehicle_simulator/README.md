## Solution Overview

CMS Vehicle Simulator is a deployable module within [Connected Mobility Solution on AWS](/README.md)
(CMS) designed to enable customers to get started quickly assessing AWS IoT services
without an existing pool of devices. This solution leverages managed, highly available, highly scalable AWS-native
services to create and simulate thousands of connected devices. These devices can use pre-defined templates, or be
customized by the customer.

For more information and a detailed deployment guide, visit the
[CMS Vehicle Simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/vehicle-simulator-module.html)
Implementation Guide page.

## AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and
[AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create
well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best
practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This solution uses the following AWS Solutions Constructs:

- [aws-cloudfront-s3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-cloudfront-s3.html)
- [aws-lambda-stepfunctions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-lambda-stepfunctions.html)

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

## Customizing the Module

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [NPM 8+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Node 18+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)

### MacOS Installation Instructions

Pyenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.12
```

Pipenv [Github Repository](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

NVM [Github Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

NPM/Node [Official Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git
cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/source/modules/cms_vehicle_simulator/
```

### Install Required Dependencies

```bash
make install
```

### Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization
pass the tests:

```bash
make test
```

### Build the Module

The build script manages dependencies, builds required assets (e.g. packaged lambdas), and creates the
AWS Cloudformation templates.

```bash
make build
```

### Upload Assets to S3

```bash
make upload
```

### Deploy on AWS

```bash
make deploy
```

### Delete

```bash
make destroy
```

## Cost Scaling

Cost will scale based on usage and storage quantities.
Basic usage (small simulations for short durations) should stay within the free tier.

- [AWS Step Functions Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/pricing/)
- [AWS Lambda Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/)
- [Amazon Cloudfront Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/)
- [Amazon DynamoDB Cost](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)

For more details, see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/cost.html).

## Collection of Operational Metrics

This solution collects anonymized operational metrics to help AWS improve
the quality and features of the solution. For more information, including
how to disable this capability, please see the
[implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/anonymized-data-collection.html).
